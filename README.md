# p4wordle
This is a quick and fun package that allows you to play Wordle via a P4 capable switch.

The pre-defined word list is found in wordle.p4. This is to be loaded onto the switch.
wordle_sender.py and wordle_receiver.py serve as the sockets on both ends.

See wordle_v2.pdf for more information.
